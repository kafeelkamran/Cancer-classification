# Cancer Classification 🧬

## 📄 Project Overview

  This project aims to classify cancer samples using a machine learning model trained on medical data. It automates early detection and improves diagnostic accuracy by distinguishing between    cancerous and non-cancerous samples.

## ✨ Features

 - High Accuracy Classification: Multi-class model trained on cancer data.
 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for improved model efficiency and accuracy.
 - Comprehensive Evaluation: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### ⚙️ Setup
  Clone the repository and install dependencies:
  
  bash

    pip install scikit-learn pandas
Place your dataset in <code>data/</code>.

### 🚀 Usage

Train and evaluate the model:

bash

    python cancer_classification.py

### 📈 Results

 Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix are saved in <code>results/</code> for further analysis.
